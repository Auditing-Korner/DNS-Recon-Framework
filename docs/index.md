# RFS DNS Framework Documentation

Welcome to the RFS DNS Framework documentation. This framework provides a comprehensive set of tools for DNS security testing, reconnaissance, and analysis.

## Core Components

### DNS Cache Poisoning Tool

Our advanced DNS cache poisoning detection and simulation tool helps security researchers identify vulnerabilities in DNS implementations. [Learn more about the DNS Cache Poisoning Tool](dns-cache-poison.md).

### Other Framework Tools

- **DNS Enumerator**: Comprehensive DNS record enumeration and analysis
- **DNS Server Finder**: Discover and test DNS servers
- **Cloud Provider Enumerator**: Detect and analyze cloud service providers
- **TLD Bruteforcer**: Multi-threaded TLD discovery
- **Cloud Takeover Detector**: Identify subdomain takeover vulnerabilities

## Quick Start
